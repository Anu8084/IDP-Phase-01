This is an Inter Departmental Project Phase 1 This project is based on Machine learning Models and M.L techniques here Project Title is Chronic Kidney disease Predictions using hybrid M.L algos here we have taken two CKD datsets and applied hybrid features sellection techniques using Chi-Square test and Lasso regressions techniques after that Ensemble ML Model has been used in this projects that includees Boosting(XG BOOST, GRADIENT BOOST,ADA BOOST) after that we are acheiving of 99.17% Accuracy and we are also getting seperate accuracies regarding Boosting algorithms We have taken 12 papers for the refernces
